        <h1>Selected Classical Works</h1>
        
        <p>If these pieces are as good as I think they are, they will speak for themselves. This fact has not stopped me from rambling a bit about each one.
            I've grouped them by time period.
        </p>

        <h2>Baroque</h2>

        <div class="title"><a href="classical/Vivaldi Summer II.mp3">Vivaldi, <em>The Four Seasons</em>, Summer, mvt. 2</a></div>
        <p class="notes">
            Vivaldi was a red-headed priest who could shred a violin. This movement from a violin concerto is 100% metal, and no one can persuade me otherwise.
        </p>

        <div class="title"><a href="classical/Bach - Orch Suite 1 - Forlane.mp3">Bach, Orchestral Suite No. 1, Forlane</a></div>
        <p class="notes">
            This jaunty little piece has three layers: a melody, a bassline, and a whirlwind of energy between them that feels like it'll go supernova at any moment.
        </p>
        
        <div class="title"><a href="classical/Bach Chaconne.mp3">Bach, Partita for Violin No. 2, mvt. 5 Chaconne</a></div>
        <p class="notes">
            Why would I include a piece containing over 15 minutes of solo violin? Brahms said of this piece: 
            <blockquote>
                On one stave, for a small instrument, the man writes a whole world of the deepest thoughts and most powerful feelings. 
                If I imagined that I could have created, even conceived the piece, I am quite certain that the excess of excitement and earth-shattering experience 
                would have driven me out of my mind.
            </blockquote>
            Joshua Bell, one of the greatest violinists in the world, said it is "not just one of the greatest pieces of music ever written, but one of the 
            greatest achievements of any man in history. It's a spiritually powerful piece, emotionally powerful, structurally perfect." 
            It's in three large sections (minor-major-minor), and it's all built on a repeating chord progression. This recording is of Itzhak Perlman playing.
        </p>

        <h2>Classical</h2>
        
        <div class="title">Beethoven, Symphony No. 7</div>
        <p class="notes">
            Beethoven is kind of a big deal, and I think this is his best symphony; it dances delightfully. My initial thought was to include only the 4th movement, but then I hated to omit the amazing
            2nd movement... and one thing led to another, so here's the whole shebang.
            <ol>
                <li><a href="classical/Beethoven 7-1.mp3">Beethoven, Symphony 7, mvt. 1</a></li>
                <li><a href="classical/Beethoven 7-2.mp3">Beethoven, Symphony 7, mvt. 2</a></li>
                <li><a href="classical/Beethoven 7-3.mp3">Beethoven, Symphony 7, mvt. 3</a></li>
                <li><a href="classical/Beethoven 7-4.mp3">Beethoven, Symphony 7, mvt. 4</a></li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <h2>Romantic</h2>
        
        <div class="title"><a href="classical/Brahms op118-2.mp3">Brahms, Intermezzo op.118 no.2</a></div>
        <p class="notes">
            Probably my favorite piano piece, although I would perform it <a href="https://youtu.be/bJbRbUiM8Mo">a bit differently</a>. I got a better digital piano since 
            I recorded this piece on YouTube, so I need to make a new recording soon.
        </p>
        
        <div class="title"><a href="classical/Brahms 1-2.mp3">Brahms, Symphony No. 1, mvt. 2</a></div>
        <p class="notes">
            Brahms' first symphony is high on the list for me, and his music is delightfully dark in general. He was a perfectionist and trashed about two thirds of 
            everything he wrote. What remains is pretty much gold.
        </p>
        
        <div class="title"><a href="classical/Brahms 3-3.mp3">Brahms, Symphony No. 3, mvt. 3</a></div>
        <p class="notes">
            Another great melody from Brahms.
        </p>
        
        <div class="title"><a href="classical/Chopin - Nocturne No. 8 in Dflat major.mp3">Chopin, Nocturne in D-flat</a></div>
        <p class="notes">
            Sometimes Chopin can be too flowery or showy for my tastes, but this nocturne is elegantly structured and beautifully expressive.
        </p>
        
        <div class="title"><a href="classical/Chopin Piano Concerto 1-2.mp3">Chopin, Piano Concerto No. 1, mvt. 2</a></div>
        <p class="notes">
            More beauty from Chopin.
        </p>

        <h2>20th Century</h2>
        
        <div class="title"><a href="classical/Chesnokov - Salvation Is Created.mp3">Pavel Chesnokov, Salvation is Created</a></div>
        <p class="notes">
            There's quite a bit of beautiful choral music by Russian composers. I think they express mystery particularly well.
        </p>
        
        <div class="title"><a href="classical/Barber - Adagio for Strings.mp3">Samuel Barber, Adagio for Strings</a></div>
        <p class="notes">
            My all-time fav. This recording is Bernstein conducting, and it's almost painfully slow. He squeezes all he can out of each note.
        </p>
        
        <div class="title"><a href="classical/Adams - China gates.mp3">John Adams, China Gates</a></div>
        <p class="notes">
            John Adams is a living composer associated with the minimalist movement. I don't rank this piece as highly as others on the list,
            but I include it because I think you might find it interesting. He has a similar piece called Phrygian Gates that is much longer.
        </p>
        
        <div class="title"><a href="classical/Whitacre - A Boy And A Girl.mp3">Eric Whitacre, A Boy and a Girl</a></div>
        <p class="notes">
            Whitacre is a living composer who has made a big impact on choral music. I admire the way he set this poem to music.

            <blockquote>
