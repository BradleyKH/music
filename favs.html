        <h2>Orchestral</h2>

        <div class="title"><a href="classical/Barber - Adagio for Strings.mp3">Samuel Barber, Adagio for Strings</a></div>
        <p class="notes">
            My all-time fav. This recording is Bernstein conducting, and it's almost painfully slow. He squeezes all he can out of each note.
        </p>

        <div class="title">
            <a href="classical/Adams - Harmonielehre 3.mp3">John Adams, Harmonielehre, mvt. 3</a>
        </div>
        <p class="notes">This ambitious three-movement piece for orchestra combines the harmonic vocabulary of the late 19th century with the principles of minimalism. Why do I like it? It is both ordered and chaotic, lyrical and percussive. It has complex, competing ideas. And the horns get to have fun!</p>

        <div class="title">Beethoven, Symphony No. 7</div>
        <p class="notes">
            Beethoven is kind of a big deal, and I think this is his best symphony; it dances delightfully.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><a href="classical/Beethoven 7-1.mp3">Beethoven, Symphony 7, mvt. 1</a></li>
                <li><a href="classical/Beethoven 7-2.mp3">Beethoven, Symphony 7, mvt. 2</a></li>
                <li><a href="classical/Beethoven 7-3.mp3">Beethoven, Symphony 7, mvt. 3</a></li>
                <li><a href="classical/Beethoven 7-4.mp3">Beethoven, Symphony 7, mvt. 4</a></li>
            </ol>

        <div class="title">Brahms, Symphony No. 1</div>
        <p class="notes">Brahms was a perfectionist, and he spent 21 years writing this piece.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><a href="classical/Brahms 1-1.mp3">Brahms, Symphony No. 1, mvt. 1</a></li>
            <li><a href="horn/Brahms 1-2.mp3">Brahms, Symphony No. 1, mvt. 2</a></li>
            <li><a href="classical/Brahms 1-3.mp3">Brahms, Symphony No. 1, mvt. 3</a></li>
            <li><a href="horn/Brahms 1-4.mp3">Brahms, Symphony No. 1, mvt. 4</a></li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>And one more symphonic movement from Brahms:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="horn/Brahms 3-3.mp3">Brahms, Symphony No. 3, mvt. 3</a></li>
        </ul>

        <div class="title"><a href="horn/Respighi - Pines of Rome.mp3">Respighi, Pines of Rome (excerpts)</a></div>

        <p class="notes">This is an extraordinarily colorful piece. The epic crescendo at the end is an inspiration to all brass players 
            - and really to all human beings with a pulse. This is an abbreviated version featured in <em>Fantasia 2000</em>.</p>

        <h2>Piano</h2>
        
        <div class="title"><a href="classical/Brahms op118-2.mp3">Brahms, Intermezzo op.118 no.2</a></div>
        <p class="notes">
            Probably my favorite piano piece to hear or to play.
        </p>
        
        <div class="title"><a href="classical/Chopin - Nocturne No. 8 in Dflat major.mp3">Chopin, Nocturne in D-flat</a></div>
        <p class="notes">
            Sometimes Chopin can be too flowery or showy for my tastes, but this nocturne is elegantly structured and beautifully expressive.
        </p>

        <h2>Other</h2>
        
        <div class="title"><a href="classical/Bach Chaconne.mp3">Bach, Partita for Violin No. 2, mvt. 5 Chaconne</a></div>
        <p class="notes">
            Why would I include a piece containing over 15 minutes of solo violin? Brahms said of this piece: 
            <blockquote>
                On one stave, for a small instrument, the man writes a whole world of the deepest thoughts and most powerful feelings. 
                If I imagined that I could have created, even conceived the piece, I am quite certain that the excess of excitement and earth-shattering experience 
                would have driven me out of my mind.
            </blockquote>
            Joshua Bell, one of the greatest violinists in the world, said it is "not just one of the greatest pieces of music ever written, but one of the 
            greatest achievements of any man in history. It's a spiritually powerful piece, emotionally powerful, structurally perfect." 
            It's in three large sections (minor-major-minor), and it's all built on a repeating chord progression. This recording is of Itzhak Perlman playing.
